Overview:

Bringing down the libraries at a same platform, which would be the first of its kind to establish a connection between them and that would be beneficial for the libraries
as well as the users. Apart from this we also have several user friendly features such as the book lending , renting as well as buying the new books.

A lot of firms are already working on this but none of them are free of cost.  Each and every firm has some charges as in membership charge for the service and also they don't have
the central library network which makes our project unique.

Project Scope:
 
This project is basically updating the manual library system into an internet-based application so that the users can know the details of their account, availability of books etc.
One of its kind for the book renting, lending as well as the book buying platform.


Working Procedure:

The libraries of a city would be enlisted with the current available books as well as the registered user can set there genre preferences upon which they can get the suggestion of the books.

Users can look upon the available books in the libraries and can make an easy decision about visiting the library for issuing the book and also they can look through the category and also
list of the available books.

After issuing a book from the library a user can be indicated to return the particular book to another library in case the nearby library is short on that particular book. For this the
use can get a few days extended time to return the book. This would ensure the flow of the book among the libraries.

Users can lend or rent their books on the platform to the other users and for that they would be provided with the generated coupons.

Coupons can later be used to do any type of transaction within the platform and can also be redeemed for the cash through online platforms.
