A description of your project:
Our Project named "BREATHE" aims at providing support and help to the ones in need.
We aim to provide a centralised system for storing data about donors and those in need of organs, while maintaining anonymity between them.
We will provide flash notifications to the recipients in case an organ is available nearby in a hospital registered in our channel. 
The notification will be redirected to the filtered users who are in need of the specified organ.
All documents (Letter of Approval/Prescription/Tests) will be uploaded on an online portal and undergo checking by a medical officer .
