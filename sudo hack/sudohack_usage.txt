TO RUN PNEUMONIA_DETECTION model


1. On GPU                             
 	Requirement for loading model :
               1. CUDA capable GPU
               2. CUDA  10.0 Tool kit (  ubuntu 18.04)
               3. cudnn7  library (need account on nvidia developer )
               4. Anaconda3 
               5. Tensorflow-gpu
               6. Pydicom(For reading DICOM files)
               7. sklearn(for labeling )
               8. matplotlib
     
2. On CPU
	Requirement for loading model:
               1. Anaconda3
               2. Tensorflow=1.11.0
               3. Pydicom
               4. sklearn
               5. matplotlib
    


  USAGE -


* you need to run check.py  given in submission folder  using python 3.6 version and it runs with administrator permission
     -    Testing to new dataset, need to change path  to  path of new dataset
     -    submission.csv file will be generated as prediction result of model.




        ** If you are loading model on cpu it takes little bit more time(approx. 40 min/  1000  images)**
      * if any problem/error is still there assist from team members *
