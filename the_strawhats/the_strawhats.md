# Description
Our project aims to simplify the proccess of issuing of certificates and other simialr and related documents via the application of  Ethereum blockchain to provide convinient and permanent solution.
- Our solution has two major components, the backend of smart contracts on the Ethrereum blockchain for storing the certificates and a web app based on flask which allowing for easy verification.
- Every user and certificate issuing organizations have a permanent address on Ethereum block-chain.
- The user gets certificates on his Ethereum address while organizations issues certificates on the name of the Ethereum address.
- Certificates can be verified for their authenticity based on the unique identification number issued to the certificate.
- Along with this, user can use it as a platform to showcase his certificates and experience. 
- It is more economical than issuing a physical copy of any certificate (approximately 3.35 INR ).
