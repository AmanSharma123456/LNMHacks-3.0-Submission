Problem Statement - Though the online learning platforms help students, but some modifications are yet to be done so that the students can utilise these resources efficiently.

Modifications / USP of our Solution -
1. The video before being uploaded is sent to our panel of mentors.
2. If mentors will find the video effective for students as per all the measures, then only it can be uploaded on our site.
3. We entertain only one video per topic so that the students won't get confused that which is to be accessed.
4. No student can use the portal without registeration on our site.
5. Student has to fill a field of interests choice form at the time of registration so that only filtered results of his field will be shown to him.
6. A more interactive GUI is embedded so that the user can easily access the resources, such that - 
    a)The categorization of content is shown using pile of cards like Tinder uses. User can swipe left and right, if he is not interested in the         category represented by top card.
    b)The latest content uploaded will be shown by some icons which will be pop-up on the screen like facebook uses emojis popping                 during live videos.
7. There will be one-to-one interaction between mentor and student via scheduling a video chat, if requested by student (as per      conveniency of both).
8. The Brain Storming tests will be conducted frequently to check the progress of students.
9. A student will only be certified for his/her respective program, if and only if he/she would be able to qualify the final examination after       their programme. It would enhance the performance and learning of student.
